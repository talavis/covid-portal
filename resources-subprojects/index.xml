      <description>A pipeline for taxonomic profiling of shotgun metagenomic data. It is currently in development and does not yet have any stable releases.
The pipeline supports metagenomic data generated both from Illumina and Nanopore sequencing technology. It performs in-parallel taxonomic profiling with multiple taxonomic classifiers against multiple databases and produces standardised output tables. In addition, it performs quality control and optional read pre-processing (adapter trimming, low-complexity filtering and host read removal).</description>

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 bioinformatics pipeline â€“ GMS Arctic</title>

      <description>A pipeline for bioinformatical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data was developed within Genomics Medicine Sweden during the spring of 2021. The pipeline extends on the analysis developed by the international collaboration ArticNetwork and the COG-UK consortium. It is currently in clinical use across Sweden and is continually updated with the latest SARS-CoV-2 variants.
The pipeline performs typing of SARS-CoV-2 data using both the Pangolin and Nextstrain classification systems. In addition, it also runs quality control, variant calling and supplies a genome consensus sequence for each sample.</description>

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 Reporter for visualization of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data (SC2reporter)</title>

      <description>A web-based visualization application for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The tool is primarily used for epidemiological analysis where pipeline analysis results and metadata are loaded into a mongoDB database. The SNVs and indels can then be compared between all isolated in the database.
